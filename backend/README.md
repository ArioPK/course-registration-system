# Backend – Course Registration System

This is the FastAPI backend for the university course registration system.

Architecture: Classic MVC-style structure adapted for a JSON API:
- Model (M): `app/models/` + `app/db/`
- View (V): `app/views/` + `app/schemas/`
- Controller (C): `app/controllers/`

In Sprint 1, the backend will provide admin login and course CRUD.
